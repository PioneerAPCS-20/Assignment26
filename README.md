# Assignment 26

Given an array of `int`s, return the largest value. You can assume the array length will be at least 1.

Please create a method called `maxVal` that takes an array of `int`s as a parameter. Your method should return the largest integer value, not the index.

`public static int maxVal(int[] nums)`

In `main` populate the array and output the result by calling the method.

### Sample Outputs

```
How many values do you want to store? 3
Enter value: 1
Enter value: 2
Enter value: 3

// nums = {1, 2, 3};

Max value is 3.
```

```
How many values do you want to store? 5
Enter value: -5
Enter value: -10
Enter value: -2
Enter value: -9
Enter value: -3

// nums = {-5, -10, -2, -9, -3};

Max value is -2. 
```

### Grading

As always, your program will be graded on its functionality according to the project specifications and proper code style.
